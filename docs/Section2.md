# Section 2 Notes

## 2.1 Tools
### 2.1.1 Quick Setup

We have used both Amazon Web Server(Ubuntu instance) and POP!OS as our development system. A fancy tool that we recommend for Windows user : MobaXterm.

Following the original book, run the commands below to install all the essential tools that you need:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential nasm genisoimage bochs bochs-sdl
