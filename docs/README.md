# little OS book notes
This documentation(or notes) was built for [littleosbook](https://littleosbook.github.io/).
We won't go too deep of our notes since the original book is clear enough.
All code are ran and tested under Ubuntu 16.04 and [POP!OS](https://system76.com/pop).
If you have any question, feel free to [contact us](https://github.com/darrenyip/littleOSNotes) :D!

This documentation site is powered by [vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) <3 and hosted on [firebase](https://littleosnotes.firebaseapp.com).

For section 2, type command `bochs -f bochsrc.txt -q` to run the system in `bochs`.
From section 3 to latter sections, type command `make run` to build and run the OS.
