# little OS book notes
This documentation(or notes) was built for [littleosbook](https://littleosbook.github.io/).
We won't go too deep of our notes since the original book is clear enough.
All code are ran and tested under Ubuntu 16.04 and [POP!OS](https://system76.com/pop).
If you have any question, feel free to [contact us](https://github.com/darrenyip/littleOSNotes) :D!
